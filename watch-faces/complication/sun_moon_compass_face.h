/*
 * Sun and Moon compass.
 *
 * Uses UTC date/time and configured latitude/longitude to estimate the
 * direction of North relative to the Sun and Moon.
 *
 * The hours field shows the Sun-based result; the minutes field shows
 * the Moon-based result. Each value is a dial position from 00 to 59,
 * increasing clockwise, with one position representing 6 degrees.
 *
 * Hold the watch level and point its 12 o'clock direction towards the
 * Sun or Moon. The corresponding displayed dial position indicates North.
 * This is a calculated direction aid, not a magnetic compass.
 *
 * Positions are recalculated on activation, periodically while active,
 * and on low-energy updates. The seconds field shows the active update
 * countdown, or 00 during low-energy updates.
 *
 * Set LAT and LON in the source or via sunrise/sunset face for your location.
